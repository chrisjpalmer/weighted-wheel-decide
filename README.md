# Weighted Wheel Decide

Its like wheeldecide.com except rigged.

Supply `http://localhost:3000/?m=chooseanyway&s=devam` to choose your favourite intern for example.

## Supported Modes

- `m=choose` - chooses the person by rotating the wheel to their name in a *totally* physically accurate way after the wheel has finished spinning.
- `m=chooseanyway` - an absolutely lazy way that just says their name even if they weren't picked.
- `m=gaslighting` - coming soon but will incorporate some maths to rotate the wheel in a physically based accurate way with the exact starting conditions to land on someones name.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
